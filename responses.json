This act governs the regulation and development of mines and minerals in the country. It was amended in 2015 to bring about significant changes in the mining sector. Here are some key provisions and aspects of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957:\n1. Mineral Ownership: The MMDR Act vests the ownership of all minerals in the central government. State governments have the authority to grant mineral concessions or leases for specific minerals within their jurisdiction. \n2. Mineral Concessions: The Act distinguishes between two types of mineral concessions – reconnaissance permits and prospecting licenses, which allow initial exploration, and mining leases, which permit the extraction of minerals. \n3. Auctioning of Mining Leases: One of the major changes introduced in the 2015 amendment is the shift towards a competitive bidding process for the allocation of mining leases. This was done to bring transparency and eliminate discretionary practices. \\n4. Royalty and Dead Rent: The Act prescribes the rates of royalty to be paid by the lessees to the state government. Additionally, lessees are required to pay a dead rent, which is a fixed annual payment irrespective of mineral production. \n5. Environmental and Forest Clearances: Mining operations require environmental and forest clearances as per the applicable laws and regulations. The MMDR Act mandates that mining operations should not be undertaken without obtaining these clearances. \n6. Rehabilitation and Resettlement: The Act contains provisions related to the rehabilitation and resettlement of affected families and communities due to mining activities. \n7. Role of the National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET): The 2015 amendment introduced the NMET, which is funded by contributions from miners. The trust is responsible for promoting mineral exploration in the country. \n8. Transferability of Mining Leases: The 2015 amendment allows for the transfer of mining leases subject to certain conditions and approvals. \n9. Offenses and Penalties: The Act includes provisions for penalties and punishments for violations, illegal mining, and other offenses related to mineral extraction. \n10. District Mineral Foundation (DMF): The MMDR Act also mandates the creation of DMFs in mining-affected districts to address the socio-economic development and welfare of affected people. \nIt's important to note that while the MMDR Act lays down the basic framework for mining regulations in India, there are several other laws and regulations at the state and central levels that govern various aspects of mining, including environmental protection, labor, safety, and land acquisition. Additionally, the legal framework may evolve over time, so it's essential to refer to the latest legislation and regulations when dealing with mining-related matters in India."]
